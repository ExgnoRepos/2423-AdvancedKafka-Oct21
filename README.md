# Advanced Kafka Repository

This is the class repository for the Advanced kafka Class Oct 21-24, 2024.

The materials in this repository will be available until Nov 24.

### Lab Repository

The lab code and guides are duplicated in a separate repository for a lightweight clone of just the lab materials into your working VM. This is located at:

[Advanced Kafka Labs](https://github.com/ExgnoRepos/2423-Kafka-Labs)

Everything in the lab repository is also in this repository.
